							<p>Setting up a dedicated team of developers is one of the best ways to organize a Custom Web Development process. So if your product needs to meet specific requirements, notice that a self-organized team of developers can be a great problem-solver.</p>
							<h3>Header 3</h3>
							<p>One of the main reasons why middle-sized and large companies decide to deliver a part of a project or an entire project to an offshore service provider is an opportunity to receive a high-quality result without hiring an internal team. Thanks to this, companies save some resources and reduce the workload.</p>
							<p>Setting up a Dedicated Development Team gives you a lot of advantages:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You get a team that concentrates only on your projects;</li>
								<li>Each developer's performance increases, because he doesn’t need to change the
									context everytime;</li>
								<li>You will save a strong amount of money without quality losses;</li>
								<li>Dedicated team is more flexible and ready to changes;</li>
								<li>You receive access to the hiring process and can choose which candidate suits you the
									best;</li>
								<li>The management team on our side takes control over the day-to-day operations and
									routine, so you will get extra time to focus on your work.</li>
